## Answer to Question
Both graceful degradation and service workers keep the site usable when conditions are not ideal. With graceful degradation, we first build the full featured experience for users, while making sure that when new features fail, the site degrades to a simpler but still fully functional version. With service worker, we are achieving similar results by intercepting requests and serving cached resources when the network is slow or down. In other words, graceful degradation is more of a design principle while service worker is one of the technologies/methodologies that lets modern web pages fulfill that design by providing an offline/low bandwidth fallback instead of a blank page with broken assets.
